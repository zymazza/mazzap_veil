"""MCP server over a VEIL digital-twin store — stdio transport.

This is the agent-facing surface of the twin: every tool is a thin wrapper
around scripts/twin_query.py (where all logic lives and is tested). The
store is read-only; the only writes are the draw_polygon / draw_point /
clear_drawings tools, which maintain data/annotations.json — ephemeral
orange drawings the 3D viewer polls and renders so an agent can point at
places on the map instead of reciting coordinates. Drawings never touch
the store or the journal.

Run it:
    python3 scripts/mcp_server.py

Register it with Claude Code:
    claude mcp add veil-twin -- python3 /abs/path/to/scripts/mcp_server.py

Conventions every tool follows:
  * Points are {"lat": deg, "lon": deg} or {"x": m, "y": m} in scene-local
    meters (x = east, y = north, the twin's projected CRS minus its origin —
    describe_twin reports which CRS). Results always echo both forms.
  * All distances/areas are meters / square meters. Heights are meters.
  * `region` arguments take exactly one of four shapes:
      {"aoi": true}                                    — the parcel AOI
      {"bbox": [minx, miny, maxx, maxy]}               — scene-local meters
      {"within_m": r, "point": {lat,lon} | {x,y}}      — circle, r in meters
      {"polygon": [[lon,lat], ...] or [[x,y], ...]}    — ring auto-closed
  * Every factual value carries provenance: source / confidence / run_id /
    observed_at from the store's observations, or acquisition / service for
    atlas layers.
  * Errors come back as {"error": ...} objects with the valid alternatives
    listed — never a stack trace.
